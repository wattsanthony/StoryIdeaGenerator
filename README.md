# StoryIdeaGenerator
Simple C# program that generates story concepts from text file lists.

Simple program that has several text files which can be populated with different information.

Information is then read and used to populate the random generator assets.

Text files must be kept in the same format, don't believe I actually made them check for anything other than reading lines!
